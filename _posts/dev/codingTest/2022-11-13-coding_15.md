### 문제 설명
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A *word* is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

### 입출력 예

#### Example 1:
> Input: s = "the sky is blue" <br/>
> Output: "blue is sky the"


#### Example 2:
> Input: s = "  hello world  " <br/>
> Output: "world hello" <br/>
> Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


#### Example 3:
> Input: s = "a good   example" <br/>
> Output: "example good a" <br/>
> Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.


### Constraints

`1 <= s.length <= 104` <br/>
`s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.` <br/>
`There is at least one word in s.` <br/>

**Follow-up**: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

## 내 솔루션

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function(s) {
  return s.split(' ').filter((w)=>w).reverse().join(' ')
};

// js array reverse 함수.
var reverseArr = function(array) {
  const reArr = [];
  for (let i = array.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reArr.push(array[i])
  }
  return reArr;
}
```

## 감상평
* JS라서 매우 쉬웠다. 휴우
